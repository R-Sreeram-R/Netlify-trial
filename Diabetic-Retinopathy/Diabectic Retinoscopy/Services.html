      <h2>Retina Scan</h2>
      <p>
        Our clinic utilizes advanced Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to analyze retinal images and detect the early signs of diabetic retinopathy. Early diagnosis is crucial for timely intervention and preventing vision loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        The retina scan is a painless and non-invasive procedure that allows our ophthalmologists to assess the health of your retina and identify any abnormalities associated with diabetic retinopathy. By detecting changes in the retina at an early stage, we can provide prompt treatment to protect your eyesight and prevent further complications.
